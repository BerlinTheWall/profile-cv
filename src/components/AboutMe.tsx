                Since I was in the middle class, I had a great passion for
                computers and technology. I chose computer engineering as my
                course in university without any hesitation and since then I
                have always tried to learn new subjects about computers and
                programming. After my first semester, I started self-studying
                web programming and watched many videos online, and created some
                projects for myself.
                <br />
                <br /> I love using my creativity and imagination in programming
                so I think web development is a proper field for me. I also love
                to meet new people and work with them. I had a great experience
                at my last job and made really good friends there. I am
                motivated and if I start something new, I donâ€™t quit it until I
                reach the level I want to be at. I really like learning new
                things, and I use my free time to learn new language programs
                and improve my skills.
